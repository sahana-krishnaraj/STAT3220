# Diabetes Prevalence Regression Project
This project was completed for my Regression class in Spring 2024 with two other group members. We explored the prevalence of Diabetes across the United States based on various socioeconomic, environmental, and demographic factors (specifically 9 variables).

Data was collected from multiple sources, including Social Explorer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and UVA Policy Map. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developed a multiple linear regression model to understand how these factors are associated with diabetes prevalence.

The project was primarily conducted in R for data cleaning, model screening, and variable building. Microsoft Excel was occasionally used to clean and group datasets.

## Repository Content
* `Diabetes_Project_Infographic`: Summarizes our key findings and insights from the regression model in a visual format. 
* `Diabetes_Project_Report`: Documents the full project workflow, including data collection, EDA, model development, analysis, and a data dictionary.

## Key Findings
Our analysis identified the most significant factors for predicting diabetes prevalence across U.S. states: Average Income, Population Density, Walkability, Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Smoking. Among these, three are quantitative variables (Average Income, Population Density, Smoking) and one is qualitative (SVI).
Based on the correlation analysis:

* Higher Population Density, SVI, and Smoking are associated with higher diabetes prevalence.

* Higher Average Income and Walkability are associated with lower diabetes prevalence.
